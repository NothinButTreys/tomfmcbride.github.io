			<h1>Welcome to Scarbrough Strong</h1>
			<p>Justin Scarbrough and his wife Hailee are such amazing people and they would do anything for anyone. Now it is our turn to help them. This site was created to help the Scarbrough family spread the word on Justin's injury updates and upcoming events to help support their needs.. </p>
			<div class="clearfix"></div>
			<div class="rCol">
				<p>Justin was hurt this past week up in Williams. He was Air-Evaced to Flagstaff, and then from Flagstaff he was flown to Phoenix for a higher level of hospital care.</p>
				<p>His wife Hailee has been with him since he was flown to Flagstaff. This has been devestating for their family. The medical bills are piling up very quickly, and Hailee has been taking time off work to be with Justin. </p>
				<p>For those of you that do not know, Justin was a deputy for YCSO for several years and then recently he went back to being a cowboy. Justin and Hailee are the type of people that would drop whatever they were doing to help their friends in need.</p> 
				<p>Please help by donating anything you can. We are thankful for your help and support for their family! We will update everyone on Justin's condition as we know more.</p>
