			<h1>Scarbrough Strong</h1>
			<p>Justin Scarbrough and his wife Hailee are such amazing people and they would do anything for anyone. Now it is our turn to help them.</p>
			<div class="clearfix"></div>
			<div class="rCol">
				<p>Justin was hurt this past week up in Williams. He was Air-Evaced to Flagstaff, and then from Flagstaff he was flown to Phoenix for a higher level of hospital care. Justin is in serious condition and has internal injuries that will require surgery. </p>
				<p>At this point we do not know a lot about his condition because we are still waiting for him to be evaluated by the doctors in Phoenix. His wife Hailee has been with him since he was flown to Flagstaff. This has been devestating for their family. The medical bills are piling up very quickly, and Hailee has been taking time off work to be with Justin. </p>
				<p>We are setting this up to be a blessing to the Scarbroughs, to help ofset the mounting cost of medical bills, and for whatever else they may need during this time. </p>
				<p>For those of you that do not know, Justin was a deputy for YCSO for several years and then recently he went back to being a cowboy. Justin and Hailee are the type of people that would drop whatever they were doing to help their friends in need.</p> 
				<p>Please help by donating anything you can. We are thankful for your help and support for their family! We will update y'all on Justin's condition as we know more.</p>
